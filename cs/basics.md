## Basics
An operating system (OS) is just a resource manager, it accomplishes this by pulling from hardware resources of one or more processors in order to provide a collection of services to the system user or users. The investigation of these resources will constitute the whole of all of computer science and software development, even if when it is not explicitly apparent.
